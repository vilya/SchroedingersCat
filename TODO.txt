-- Code cleanup --

* Turn functions into methods:
  - Move UpdateXXX into the relevant classes.
  - StartNewGame -> GameData::startGame()
  - StartNewLife -> GameData::startNewLife()
  - SetPowerUp -> Player::powerUp(PowerUp powerUp).
* Split up gamedata.h/.cpp into one .h/.cpp pair for each of the classes in
  there.
* Rename GameData to Game.
