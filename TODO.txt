* Get some particles on screen and moving.
* Collision detection between player and particles (pixel-accurate!)
* Respawn logic for when you run into a particle (brief - 1 second? - period of invulnerability after respawn).
* Paint some textures for player, particles, play area.
* Load in the textures and update the rendering to use them.
* Work on the game logic (rate at which particles spawn, particle movement & reflection).
* Add special player abilities.
